This plugin allows your visitors to upload User Generated Content (media and posts/custom-post-types with media).

== Description ==

This plugin gives you an ability to easily accept, moderate and publish user generated content (currently, there are 3 modes: media, post, post + media). The plugin allows you to create a front end form with multiple fields (easily customizable with shortcodes). You can limit which MIME-types are supported for each field. All of the submissions are safely held for moderation in Media/Post/Custom Post Types menu under a special tab "Manage UGC". Review, moderate and publish. It's that easy!

This plugin supports multiple uploads for modern browsers (sorry, no IE). Multiple file uploads are enabled for default form. To use it in your custom shortcode add multiple="" attribute to file shortcode.

Here's example of default form (you don't need to enter all that if you want to use default form, just use [fu-upload-form]):

[fu-upload-form class="your-class" title="Upload your media"]
[textarea name="caption" class="textarea" id="ug_caption" description="Description (optional)"]
[input type="file" name="photo" id="ug_photo" class="required" description="Your Photo" multiple=""]
[input type="submit" class="btn" value="Submit"]
[/fu-upload-form]

By default plugin allows all MIME-types that are whitelisted in WordPress. However, there's a filter if you need to add some exotic MIME-type. Refer to Other notes -> Configuration filters.

= New in v0.4 =

Now your visitors are able to upload not only media, but guest posts as well! 
Use [fu-upload-form form_layout="post_image"] to get default form to upload post content and images
Use [fu-upload-form form_layout="post"] to get default form to upload post content

You can also manage UGC for selected custom post types (Please refer to the plugin's settings page). By default, UGC is enabled for posts and attachments. If you want to be able to get any other post types UGC submissions just select desired post types at the plugin's settings page, and pass post_type='my_post_type' to the [fu-upload-form] shortcode
