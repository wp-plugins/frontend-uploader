This plugin allows your visitors to upload User Generated Content (media and posts/custom-post-types with media).

== Description ==

This plugin gives you an ability to easily accept, moderate and publish user generated content (currently, there are 3 modes: media, post, post + media). The plugin allows you to create a front end form with multiple fields (easily customizable with shortcodes). You can limit which MIME-types are supported for each field. All of the submissions are safely held for moderation in Media/Post/Custom Post Types menu under a special tab "Manage UGC". Review, moderate and publish. It's that easy!

This plugin supports multiple uploads for modern browsers. Multiple file uploads are enabled for default form. To use it in your custom shortcode add multiple="" attribute to file shortcode.

If you want to customize your form, please refer to FAQ section.

By default plugin allows all MIME-types that are whitelisted in WordPress. However, there's a filter if you need to add some exotic MIME-type. Be sure to check out FAQ to get a grasp on how to customize the upload form with actions and filters.

= New in v0.5 =

You can choose what type of files you allow your visitors to upload from Frontend Uploader Settings

= New in v0.4 =

Now your visitors are able to upload not only media, but guest posts as well!
Use [fu-upload-form form_layout="post_image"] to get default form to upload post content and images
Use [fu-upload-form form_layout="post"] to get default form to upload post content

You can also manage UGC for selected custom post types (Please refer to the plugin's settings page). By default, UGC is enabled for posts and attachments. If you want to be able to get any other post types UGC submissions just select desired post types at the plugin's settings page, and pass post_type='my_post_type' to the [fu-upload-form] shortcode.

= Shortcode parameters =

The [fu-upload-form] shortcode has several parameters that can modify its behavior:

1. 'title' => Headline that will be displayed before the form
1. 'class' => HTML class of the form, defaults to 'validate'. If you want your form being validated - do not remove validate class
1. 'category' => ID of category the post should be attached (only in post or post+image mode). The category should be whitelisted in the settings
1. 'success_page' => URL to redirect on successful submission, defaults to the URL where the form is being displayed
1. 'form_layout' => There are three different modes: post, post_image, image. Default is image
1. 'post_id' => ID of the post the image should be attached to. Defaults to current post id
1. 'post_type' => Any registered whitelisted post type. Defaults to 'post'. Works only in post and post+image modes.

= Example of default media upload form =
Here's example of default form (you don't need to enter all that if you want to use default form, just use [fu-upload-form]):

`[fu-upload-form class="your-class" title="Upload your media"]
[input type="text" name="post_title" id="title" class="required" description="Title" multiple=""]
[textarea name="post_content" class="textarea" id="ug_caption" description="Description (optional)"]
[input type="file" name="photo" id="ug_photo" class="required" description="Your Photo" multiple=""]
[input type="submit" class="btn" value="Submit"]
[/fu-upload-form]`

= I want to customize my form =
You can include additional elements with a set of shortcodes
[input type="text" name="post_title" id="title" class="required" description="Title" multiple=""]
[select name="foo" class="select" id="ug_select" description="Pick a fruit" values="Apple,Banana,Cherry"]
[textarea name="post_content" class="textarea" id="ug_caption" description="Description (optional)"]

= I want to be allow users to upload mp3, psd, or any other file restricted by default. =
You are able to do that within Frontend Uploader Settings admin page. The settings there cover the most popular extensions/MIME-types.
The trick is that the same file might have several different mime-types based on setup of server/client.
If you're experiencing any issues, you can set WP_DEBUG to true in your wp-config.php or put
`add_filter( 'fu_is_debug', '__return_true' );` in your theme's functions.php to see what MIME-types you are having troubles with.

[FileExt](http://filext.com/) is a good place to find MIME-types for specific file extension.

Let's say we want to be able to upload 3gp media files.

First we look up all MIME-types for 3gp: http://filext.com/file-extension/3gp

Now that we have all possible MIME-types for .3gp, we can allow the files to be uploaded.

Following code whitelists 3gp files, if it makes sense to you, you can modify it for other extensions/mime-types.
If it confuses you, please don't hesitate to post on support forum.
Put this in your theme's functions.php
`add_filter( 'fu_allowed_mime_types', 'my_fu_allowed_mime_types' );
function my_fu_allowed_mime_types( $mime_types ) {
	// Array of 3gp mime types
	// From http://filext.com (there might be more)
	$mimes = array( 'audio/3gpp', 'video/3gpp' );
	// Iterate through all mime types and add this specific mime to allow it
	foreach( $mimes as $mime ) {
		// Preserve the mime_type
		$orig_mime = $mime;
		// Leave only alphanumeric characters (needed for unique array key)
		preg_replace("/[^0-9a-zA-Z ]/", "", $mime );
		// Workaround for unique array keys
		// If you-re going to modify it for your files
		// Don't forget to change extension in array key
		// E.g. $mime_types['pdf|pdf_' . $mime ] = $orig_mime
		$mime_types['3gp|3gp_' . $mime ] = $orig_mime;
	}
	return $mime_types;
}`

= Configuration Filters =

= fu_manage_permissions =

By default Frontend Uploader could be managed with 'edit_posts' capability, if you want to change permissions, this is the right filter
`add_filter( 'fu_manage_permissions', create_function( '$cap', 'return "edit_others_posts"; ) );`

= fu_allowed_mime_types =

Allows you to add your custom MIME-types. Please note that there might be multiple MIME types per file extension.

`add_filter( 'fu_allowed_mime_types', 'my_fu_allowed_mime_types' );
function my_fu_allowed_mime_types( $mime_types ) {
	$mp3_mimes = array( 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/x-mpeg', 'audio/mp3', 'audio/x-mp3', 'audio/mpeg3', 'audio/x-mpeg3', 'audio/mpg', 'audio/x-mpg', 'audio/x-mpegaudio' );
	foreach( $mp3_mimes as $mp3_mime ) {
		$mime = $mp3_mime;
		preg_replace("/[^0-9a-zA-Z ]/", "", $mp3_mime );
		$mime_types['mp3|mp3_' . $mp3_mime ] = $mime;
	}
	return $mime_types;
}`

= fu_after_upload =

`add_action( 'fu_after_upload', 'my_fu_after_upload' );

function my_fu_after_upload( $attachment_ids ) {
	// do something with freshly uploaded files
	// This happens on POST request, so $_POST will also be available for you
}`

= fu_additional_html =

Allows you to add additional HTML to form

`add_action('fu_additional_html', 'my_fu_additional_html' );

function my_fu_additional_html() {
?>
<input type="hidden" name="my_custom_param" value="something" />
<?php
}`
